This is just a bunch of text being used in order to test the ability
to load in files. Nothing special. You might think having a test
like this is overkill, and probably it is. But it's more about the
principle of the thing! I come from a testing background,
it wouldn't be right to not have this publically released code of
mine not be thoroughly tested!

In fact, I'll have you know that this very test did some real good.
This test actually failed the first time around. Though maybe
my inability to get something so simple right the first time
around says something about my coding ability......

NOPE! Everyone makes mistakes :)
A smart programmer recognizes this!
